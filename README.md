# Restricted-TRL
Restricted Tree-based Reinforcement Learning Simulation

- `simulation_true_pi.R` and `simulation_wrong_pi.R` are the main simulation files using true or wrong propensity score models, respectively.
- `TRL Functions.R` stores functions for original TRL method.
- `Assignx3.R` stores true treatment assignment and true optimal regimes for the simulation.
